# 📊 Customer Behavior Analysis  
End-to-end data analysis project using **Python → MySQL → Power BI**  

This project focuses on understanding customer purchasing patterns, category performance, shipping preferences, and customer segmentation.  
I started by cleaning and transforming raw data in Python, then moved the refined dataset into MySQL for deeper analysis.  
Finally, I visualized key insights using Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.
